    <td>I learnt via listening this lesson, as it wasn't your normal fuze box lesson. Mr Keen was speaking and everyone had to listen to what things you needed to do to get a better grade. They included: Good colour scheme,
Editing of .scss and .yml files,
Editing of .html file,
Creative writing and reflections are deep and insightful.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The lesson didn't really give that much to get wrong, other than perhaps what not to do with your blogs.
It included the opposite of the above.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Again, not much you can change except for maybe to try and hit the things to get you the better marks.</td>
