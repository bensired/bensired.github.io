In this lesson we mostly talked about bits and Bytes as well as things like multiplication by 2 (called a binary shift because all numbers shift to the left one). 

8 bits = 1 Byte

1024 Bytes = 1 kB

1024 kB = 1 mB

1024 mB = 1 GB

1024 GB = 1 TB

1024 TB = 1 PB (peta byte)

I thought that it was interesting to see how many bits were even in a kB, let alone how many bits are in a PB. I also took in how one bit is referring to one binary number and then seeing how many binary numbers you could get in kB, mB, GB.

Within 8 bits, you can take in 256 binary numbers

Within 64 bits, you can take 18.5 quintillion numbers.

I thought that it was insane how the numbers escalate so quickly, also the idea that a 64 bit RAM could hold 18.5 quintillion 'ideas' at once.

Floating points are the decimal points of binary in effect. You use this in the same way that you would in dinary, when there is not a full integer. To divide by two, you shift all numbers to the left. In binary, the 'decimals' can be inaccurate. You can't get to certain fractions for example ⅓ or ⅙ or any recurring decimal. This made me realise how the notation in decimal like fractions and the dot above the recurring number were more needed than at first glance.
