    <td>We started learning spreadsheets which was new to us so we learnt by having new information handed to us and then applying it onto our practice spreadsheet using different examples. For example if on the board there was a row of numbers 1-5 and the example showed to sum all the numbers then we would get another set of random numbers and use the same method to add them together.</td>

    <td>There wasn't anything that limited my learning today as there wasn't much to get wrong. If there was something to get wrong then I didn't get it wrong so there were also no habits to work on.</td>
