  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using the example and using how the example did it into my own code. This is a good method until you do it wrong and don't know where you went wrong. For example, this week I got stuck by using an uppercase letter instead of lowercase. Mistakes like this can’t be picked up through the technique.

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was the uppercase lowercase incident. It took up half the lesson and stopped me getting any further. A habit I need to work on is to rewrite my code if I can’t work out what it is and change things like that.</td>
