  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using the skills I learnt from other lessons to carry forward into this lesson as we were just finishing off our spreadsheet work so we would all be on the same level. A strategy that helped to do this was setting the spreadsheet out neatly to avoid confusion.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Nothing really limited my learning this lesson, as it was more of getting the tables and words in place rather than code.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by just making the table on my spreadsheet slightly neater, making it easier to read and understand. I will also colour it in for it to become super obvious on what is what.
