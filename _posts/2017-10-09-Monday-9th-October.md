  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by thinking of ideas that would apply to the situation at hand, our example, what costs does a company have? After that we had a look at our blog and we learnt how to embed our spreadsheet onto our blog. A strategy that was effective was to note down the code being said for later use. This meant that as long as I noted down the code correctly, the embed spreadsheet would work. The spreadsheet that I have been working on is at the bottom of the page.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>This lesson there wasn't much to get wrong as we looked at costs to a company and then used a table to look at payroll which was simple multiplication. After that we looked at our blogs, but didn't put anything into practice so there wasn't much to get wrong or anything that would have limited my learning.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by just making the table on my spreadsheet slightly neater, making it easier to read and understand. I will also colour it in for it to become super obvious on what is what.
