    <td>I learnt like last week because I found it effective. It was looking at the top where it gave an example and after reading all the text, I tried to make the layout copy of it (where applicable) however just change the words. I have currently learnt all of the functions and am looking into the 'Python Lists and Dictionaries' section.

    <td>There wasn't anything that limited my learning this week, I flew past all the exercises without any stops. Every time I could just succeed first or second try.</td>
