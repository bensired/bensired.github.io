    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by putting down what was in the book, then analysing the words and try to define their meaning. This worked quite well because it was effective and quick, making sure I was getting the most information from the lesson as possible  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was re learning most of what we did last week as a recap to help us in this lesson. This in turn, slowed us down.

Habits I need to work on - Making sure I know which plugs specifically go where and know when we are missing a cable </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time, I would try to learn some of the more complicated vocab within the script in the book. This will improve my learning because it will increase my understanding of it.</td>
