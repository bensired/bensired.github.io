    <td>I learnt by using the example and using how the example did it into my own code. This is a good method until you do it wrong and don't know where you went wrong. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was the code becoming a lot more complex. It used code that I learnt weeks ago which meant it took trial and error to work out what to do again.</td>
