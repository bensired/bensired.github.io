**Monday 20th June**

Blog post - Every week.

The blog is meant to be about what you learn each week. Not what a list of what happened each week.

Example: I used these functions and I need to do this to get better at this. 

Not: I came in and did tutorial 3. I left after completing it.

What I did on the lesson of Monday 20th June.

The class were fixing their blog posts because the current blog repositories were flawed. I had fixed mine in March, however, so I have revised how to set up the blog. 

1. Search jerkll-now into github.

2. Fork it

3. Sort out the  _config.yml file, putting in your own information.

4. Find suitable colours and fonts to use in the body of the blog, CSS file.

5. Post.
