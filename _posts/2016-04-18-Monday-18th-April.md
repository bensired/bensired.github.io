**Monday 18th April**

Today, we looked at our Prezi's and what are good and bad about them. We found lots of mistakes in the way of grammatical errors and pleasing on the eye. We also looked and one that was half copied and pasted, which was marked as a fail because of such. Then we looked at our homework. We have another week before the prezis are going to be marked so re-check them for errors. Also, Fill in a blog post survey of someone elseâ€™s and mark it on the spreadsheet.
