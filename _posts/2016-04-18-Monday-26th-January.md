Monday 26th January

To start the lesson, we looked at people's homeworks and we marked them with excellent, good, satisfactory and unsatisfactory. After, we looked at the advantages and disadvantages of the media. We decided that things like 'Anyone can follow you’ were wrong, because you can just make your profile private to friends. Equally, we also thought about ‘If you put something on there that you will regret in the future, then don’t put it on there.’

There was, 'Social media is good for getting a message across to people'

'Social media is good to contact people in emergencies' etc.
