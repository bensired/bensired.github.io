    <td>We learnt by trying to do every possibility in a sequence of actions to make sure that one would be right. This was because the wires wouldn't work for when we did it first, and second, and third tries…

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning is not having too much time to work with the robot arm and to see how it worked before the end of the lesson. This meant that for the last 10 or so minutes we were trying to work out what bit of the robot arm wasn’t plugged in as the programme said "The USB is not connected". </td>

    <td>The thing I will change next time is the time we spend on the robot arm and to make sure I know what I’m doing with it.</td>
