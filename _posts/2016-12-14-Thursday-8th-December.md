    <td>I learnt by reading the instructions that were given to me and processing them in my brain to then execute. The strategy that was effective the most was reading the topic starter and looking at the example that it gave to set as a template for my piece of code.

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was my memory. This was because that goes from (for me) an easy stage to a really difficult stage within 4 exercises and then and the end you have to remember all of them. The habit I need to work on is to think about the question a bit more before clicking hint. I only pressed it a couple times but I wouldn't of needed to if I spent a bit longer testing combinations.</td>
