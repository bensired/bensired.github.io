**Monday 14th March**

 At first we looked at our homework from before, which was 

What is a Trojan?, 

What is a Worm?

What is a Virus?

What is Spyware and what does it do?

What is a peripherals?

How do malware transfer and get between devices?

We then got introduced to a new website called prezi (prezi.com). We made our account using our school email, and looked at different presentations that Mr Keen had prepared. One was on a CV type presentation, and the other one was on a school safety to show to parents. On both of them, they had good transition processes between slides, especially the latter. When you went to the later bits of the second presentation you could see how far in you were to start with. We then used the tools on prezi for a little bit to prepare us for the homework.
