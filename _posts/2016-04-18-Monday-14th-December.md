Today we went over how to fix the problems that were happening within the class. This included:

In file name, you might not have a date

In type, It had to say post.

You needed to have only _posts ticked for 'Your GitHub Repos' not the bensired.github.io as well.

Towards the end of it, we looked at the scss file. Head: The code that noone sees. Body: The code that shows the background, the text colour etc.
