    <td>We learnt the same way as last week as we didn't know a) what we were doing at the start of the lesson and b) how to do the thing we would be told to do. I learnt by getting broad information from the teacher and then making it more specific on my spreadsheet.</td>

    <td>The thing that limited my learning was not working out how =vlookup worked until near the end of the lesson. This slowed my progress down a lot considering it was all we could do at the end of the lesson, I just got it a bit too late.</td>
