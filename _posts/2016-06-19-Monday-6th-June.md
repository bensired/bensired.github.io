**Monday 6th June**

Today we had a cover teacher and we continued our work on the tutorials on micro:bit. I finished this quickly and then went on to plan my game. The game we were making would be coded on micro:bit, and it would have to use if and while alliterations. We had to make a plan which was: 

1) Name of Game

2) Purpose of game

3) Number of players

4) What inputs will the game have?

5) What processes will the program calculate?

6) What outputs will the game have?
