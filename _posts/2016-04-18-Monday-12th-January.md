Monday 12th January

Today we started to look at a new topic: The Media.

We had a bingo sheet, filled with media related things, such as 'Do you have your own computer?' and ‘Can you do a foreign dance?’

We had to go around the class and ask each other these questions. If they said yes, then we would tick them off, if they said no, if we would move on. We did this until Mr Keen said to stop.

Then we watched an advertisement, about a couple fat hamsters, who worked out until they were fit, for the premier. This advert was to advertise a KIA car. We looked at this and thought, what is the message underlying? What is the real meaning of the advert? etc.
