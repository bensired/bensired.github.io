**What is a computer virus?**

A computer virus is something that enters the device without user's consent. They can come up with messages on the screen, or they could be more severe and wipe its memory or even make the computer become 'bricked’ (when the computer doesn’t start anymore).

**What is a Trojan?**

A trojan is like a computer virus but it focuses on breaching security in the computer. It normally gets downloaded from looking like a useful program on have on your device but actually easily gets into your device.

**What is a Worm?**

A worm tries to steal personal information or completely takes over the computer making it a 'bot'. It normally makes it way into the computer by exploiting bugs in not malicious software. It will eventually make its way onto the network and will attack all devices on that network. 

**What are peripherals?**

A peripheral is a part of a computer that gives information into the computer, or gets it out of the computer. These are called 'input devices', ‘output devices’ and ‘storage devices’. An ‘Input device’ is a part that sends information to the computer eg. Mouse, Keyboard. An ‘Output device’ is a part that sends information out of the computer eg. Monitors, printers. A ‘Storage device’ is a part that stores information outside the hardware eg. touchscreens.

**What is spyware and what does it do?**

Spyware is software that tries to gain information about someone without their consent or it might take control of the computer itself. It is often hard to find, hence the name 'spyware'. It can also be installed by company owners to track workers internet history and progress.

**How do viruses and other malware spread from one to another?**

It spreads by pop-ups online, by email attachments etc. Also it spreads into the network and into other devices connected to the network. Mostly, however, it is gained without consent online.

**BLOG POST:**

**Monday 7th March**

Today we started a new topic: Internet safety. We looked at Viruses, Trojans, Worms and malware in general to start off. Mr Keen thought we knew more about parts of a computer, but as we didn't do this at primary school, we spent most of the lesson looking at different bits of a computer eg. CPU and Hardware. We also looked at what makes up the memory of the computer at the back of room, and what parts of it it had. It looked rather like a record player.
