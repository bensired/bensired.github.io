Monday 22nd February

How was it like to create your identity map?It made me think about memories from the past, and holidays, because I put Cyprus as a section.

How did I feel about sharing my map with the rest of the class this way?

Anyone could have wrote anything, nice or bad and you don't know who; so worried

How did it feel to comment on the identity maps?It feel harsh, because you commented what you thought. and if it was negative then you would be putting down work that had been worked on for hours.

Did I enjoy the process, or would I prefered doing it normally?

I liked this process more because you could see each project and relate to your own.

How did it feel to receive my comments?

It was basically what I already knew. A bit scruffy, but good information

How is this process different than online?

You know who you were marking, you could speak to them about it after.

Did the map help with what you want to post on social media?

I don't use social media anyways, but it gave me an idea for the future.

Any other changes for social media?

N/A

How did these lessons change the way you look at social media?

It is more attention seeking and advertising in stranger ways online than you would expect offline.

How did these lessons change the way you look at social media for in the future?I learned the advertising scale of social media, and how perfected it is. I learnt that there is lots of companies who missell their clients with something that isn't the real thing.
