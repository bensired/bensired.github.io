**Thursday 8th September**

After looking through my year 7 blogs, I can see things in a different way. More sophisticated and looking at the bigger picture. I feel like I have got better at thinking logically, especially with something like coding.

Talking about my weaknesses, I don't think I am as good at writing long pieces of work because I think I summarize more than explain in detail. Personally, itâ€™s not quite my forte. To add, in blogs, I say what has happened in the lesson rather than what I have learnt. This is probably because it is easier to write what happened. So, if I were to give myself a target then it would probably be both of those.
