  <tr>
    <td>I learnt different commands that the computer would take, and I learnt what buttons did what. The main ones were F2 - opens up the script page. F3 - Starts the script.

The strategies that were effective were going onto the commands and instead of putting, per say, the colour that was put in the example, I would change the colour and experiment with what colours look nice together (background and text)</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was getting the computer up quickly to get onto the coding part of the lesson (the main bit). We can improve this by getting used to knowing what goes where.

A habit I need to work on is going a lot quicker through the manuals. Instead of messing with the little details on the screen, I need to look at the bigger picture.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will go through the manual by skim-reading the words and looking at the commands. This means that I will get through the manual a lot quicker and still learn around the same amount.

I will improve my learning by getting more time in by getting the computer set up quicker. By now, I know what things I need and where they go.</td>
