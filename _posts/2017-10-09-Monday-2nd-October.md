    <td>We learnt the same way as last week as we didn't know a) what we were doing at the start of the lesson and b) how to do the thing we would be told to do. We were given some basic logic and then told to make the order form return "No Item" if the vlookup returned false. Also we were told to make the cost go to 0.00 instead N/A because if it said N/A it would ruin the syntax below it for the VAT, Delivery, Subtotal and hence the total price. Finally we had a failsafe so that only discount codes that are given out can be used instead of everything that starts AR, AX, AY.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was not being able to work out how to return “No Item” if the vlookup returned false. Doing it for my homework I found out that my logic was right however my syntax and where to put brackets was not. Because I was so endorsed in that, I didn't start fixing the discount codes which put me back behind a bit in the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to look into the logic of a piece of syntax and look at the structure of it when it is being taught to avoid long sustaining errors.</td>
