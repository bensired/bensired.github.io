**Monday 3rd July**

Today we had a look at what we use social media sites for. Entertainment, Gossip and catching up on school work, were just some of the ideas that came up. Then we started to look at what makes us scared on the internet. We looked at what defines child harassment, as in if the picture was made to sexually arouse, then it is. If it was made to say 'Look at Johnny in the bath!' and it so happened to get nudes on it, then that is completely different.
