In the lesson we learnt how to convert numbers from dinary to binary and dinary to hexadecimal and vice versa. We then went on to go from hexadecimal into binary

Dinary → Binary

Take 13 (d). To put in into binary you need to count in base 2.

16	8	4	2	1

The numbers need to add up to 13. To signal that you want to use a number in addition to 13, you put a 1 and if you dont then you put a 0. 13 would be 

16	8	4	2	1

0	1	1	0	1

as 8+4+1=13

Dinary → Hexadecimal

Hexadecimal is in base 16. The numbers go from 0-9 and then A = 10 B = 11 C = 12 D = 13 E = 14 F = 15

The number/letter on the furthest right represents itself. The number/letter on the 2nd furthest right represents itself x 16

Take 30 (d)

It is higher than 15 and isn't a multiple of 16 so it’ll need 2 letters/numbers

30/16 = 1 r 14

This means that the figure is 1E (1 for amount of 16s and E for the remainder)

Hexadecimal → Binary

Base 16 and Base 2 fit quite nicely as 2x8=16.

Take 3E (h)

3x16 = 1x16 and 2x16 meaning that the 3 is equal to 0011

The E = 14 which is 1110

Put the two together and 00111110
