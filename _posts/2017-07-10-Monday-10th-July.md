    <td>I learnt by writing my code out and then reading through the instructions again and looking at my code. I would say the instructions out loud and either say 'Yep that's it’ or ‘oh missed that’.

This method got me through an exercise that I was stuck on for awhile. However I did it for another exercise and it didn't work but it could be added onto another method. I got to 47%</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was forgetting what terminology was used in previous weeks which meant I had to figure it out myself which slowed me down enormously. I had only just remembered what looping the list was, I knew how to do it but got confused when it asked me to do it because I wasn't sure what it was.</td>
