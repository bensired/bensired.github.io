    <td>I learnt by watching this lesson, as I didn't know much about any of it. My partner copied the diagram as best as he could, but the LED wouldn't light up. Someone came over and explained that the circuit needed to end onto the ground icon to complete the circuit. Hence, I learnt by listening.</td>

    <td>The thing that limited my learning was not know much about the thing we were doing and then sitting back for most the lesson because it wasn't my thing.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to become more active within the lesson, helping out and making sure the code is correct.</td>
