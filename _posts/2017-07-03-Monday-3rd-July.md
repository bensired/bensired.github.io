    <td>The code as an example and the words underneath explaining what it did, were really helpful to understand what to do. The exercises, however, were quite long which meant that one mistake was a lot harder to figure out to short exercises. I did 3-4 exercises yet didn't go up any percent overall.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was forgetting what terminology was used in previous weeks which meant I had to figure it out myself which slowed me down enormously.</td>
