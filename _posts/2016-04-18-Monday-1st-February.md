Monday 1st February

We looked at how we are connected to social media by splitting up in 3's and thinking about all things good or bad, how we are connected. We then came up with a list of social media gains and disadvantages. We then watched a twitter musical and discussed the lyrics and if it was for or against twitter.

Also special mentions to the lyrics 'Im literally twittering, my life is now complete'

'It's literary littering, with every single tweetâ€™
