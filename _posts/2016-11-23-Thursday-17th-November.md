    <td>Considering we hadn't done the fuze box in 4 weeks, we were slightly rusty with how to get everything set up etc.
In a couple tries, however, we got the setup working to find that the screen was zoomed in a lot.
We found out that it was the way that the fuze box signalled to the monitor. As such, we found another fuze box and connected it to the same monitor. Hey presto, it worked.
We quickly went on and did 2.1.
I learnt by logical thinking: if the monitor is fine then don’t change it. If the fuze box isn’t fine; don’t change it.</td>

    <td>The thing that limited my learning, ultimately, was that problem. It slowed us down and stopped us having as much time with the wires and where that all went; it took around half an hour.</td>

    <td>The thing I will change for next time, is to make sure that I choose a fuze box that doesn't malfunction (although, now if it did then we’d know to fix it almost immediately.)</td>
