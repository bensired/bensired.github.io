We had to use our knowledge in making conversations to make a Buzzfeed quiz. To do this we had to take a numerical value from the questions. We did this by using the code: Q1 = input("-question- -option 1- -option 2- -option 3-") where the answer would be one, two or three. Q1 would equal this number.

At the end you would add Q1 + Q2 + Q3 etc. To get a total score. Then split the total score into sections to get a final answer to the question. The problem to this was if they didn't put 1,2 or 3. You could use the while loop to solve this by making Q1Ref = 1 until the answer was 1,2 or 3.

I learnt mostly by using the template that was on the board, but with my own question and options. I could improve my learning by either memorising the code or copying and pasting it then changing the variables, questions and options.
