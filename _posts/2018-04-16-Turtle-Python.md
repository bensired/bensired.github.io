In I.T. we have learning python (with turtle) on repl.it

The first thing that we did was that we made our names in bubble writing using python code. This may sound easy but when your name has a B in it, getting the curves perfect was tricky, let alone having the D inside of that curve to make it bubble writing. I tried trial and error until the B outline looked good but the D inside needed a little more effort as the D looked lopsided. In the end after putting in numbers into circle formulae, I got there.

The E and the N were easy to do as they didn't have curves in them, long winded sure but easy once you got the hang of it. 

We used the code:

import turtle

turtle.shape("x")

turtle.color("y")

turtle.speed(z)

at the start of the code to make the turtle function properly.

After we had done our names, we looked to have a conversation with ourselves/people around us. We used mainly if, elif and else statements to do this. A portion of my code looked like:

print("So how's the weather? Good or bad?")

weather = input ()

if weather == ("Good"):

  print("That's good!")

elif weather == ("Bad"):

  print("That's unfortunate")

else:

  print("Sure...")

In my code I talked about the weather (like above) and their favourite colour.
