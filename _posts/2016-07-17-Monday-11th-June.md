**Monday 11th July**

Homework:

**Released on Tuesday**

This picture catches your eye because at a first glance, it could be something quite serious, an outbreak of a dangerous creature. It relates something to the situation that has no relevance to the thing it is trying to say.

**Released on Thursday**

This gets your attention because it uses abusive language as its big lettering, in a bold colour. This is deceiving because the actual story is at the bottom, rather than it being the main headline.

**Released on Friday**

The informal way that it describes how they we're killed makes it seem like there was some sort of gladiator fight, rather than someone ramming others via truck. Also, when it says 'Massacreâ€™ it sounds like there was a mini civil war. Basically, the newspaper is hyping it up more than it seems, with its word choice.
