    <td>I learnt by reading the instructions that were given to me and processing them in my brain to then execute. The strategy that was effective the most was reading the topic starter and looking at the example that it gave to set as a template for my piece of code.

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was that I tried to change the same bits of my code over and over again but didn't check other bits. This made me really confused when I couldn't advance to the next stage and where abouts I was going wrong. This is a habit I need to work on.</td>
