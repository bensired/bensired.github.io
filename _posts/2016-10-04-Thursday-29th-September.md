(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I looked through my _sass file and looked at where colours are stored, where tables are stored, et cetera. Then I looked at what things I could do with that bit of code and all the things I would need to do to implement it. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning was not understanding where the css folder was for most the lesson because my css folder was in another folder that I didn't see. The habit I need to work on is to keep on looking for the right thing and not give up halfway through.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The stuff I will change for next time is the pace that I worked at. I worked at a slow pace because I kept on looking to see which file the thing I was looking for I was in. It will improve my learning because it means I will get more done in  the lesson.</td>
