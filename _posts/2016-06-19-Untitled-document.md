**Monday 13th June**

Today we came in and went onto an anonymous survey which was about limits at home and things you do on the computer at home. Then we finished our plans for our game, and started them. I found that it was difficult to start, but then it was easier as I progressed. I did forget to save it onto my google drive before going off though.
