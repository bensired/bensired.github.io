**Caesar Shifts**

I learnt by listening to the new topic and figuring out how to code it into Google Sheets. A strategy that was effective to do this was to work through each step one at a time making sure that it worked entirely before moving on. For example, if the vlookup returns false then it says N/A which messes with contenate. So I used skills from lessons before and put an iserror before the statement in the same layout used when we did the order form.

Nothing really limited my learning this lesson but the fact that you needed to write down the code into many different boxes and although there is a way around it using $ and then autocomplete, I thought it would be quicker to just do it manually instead of searching how to lay it out in the code. (It wasn't).

I will change my learning by testing different ideas out within the same broader idea once I have finished the work set which will improve my learning as well due to understanding the broader idea to a plum.
