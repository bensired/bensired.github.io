  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using our partners effectively. Instead of having one person typing and one person messing around with the mouse, we took it in turns to type. This is because our backs started to hurt if we were there for too long. That meant we were getting through the sections twice as fast.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning is working out how to save the projects. It took us a good amount of time to realise how you do it. A habit I need to work on is to find a way to save time for doing something like saving the file.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> The thing I will change for next time is how quick I am with saving projects because it took a long time to figure out how to not just make it crash. I will improve my learning by using teamwork more efficiently in the future.</td>
